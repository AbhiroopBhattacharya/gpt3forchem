## Install

    pip install gpt3forchem

You'll also need to install `gpflow` from the `develop` branch: `pip install git+https://github.com/GPflow/GPflow.git@develop`

## How to use

- the `legacy` directory contains code from initial exploration. The
  relevant parts have been migrated into notebooks.

- the `experiments` directory contain code for the actual fine-tuning
  experiments

Before you can use it, you need to set up the OpenAI API access (you
might need to export your `OPENAI_API_KEY`)

Also, you need to keep in mind that there are [rate
limits](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5955598-is-api-usage-subject-to-any-rate-limits)
wherefore we needed to add some delays between requests (and typically
also not evaluate on the full datasets).
