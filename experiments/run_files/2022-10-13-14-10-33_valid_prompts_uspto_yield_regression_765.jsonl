The reaction was essentially completed within 15 min. The reaction mixture was concentrated to give a solid. A sample of salt free Apo7056 product was obtained by purification using the Biotage\u00a9 instrument (C18 reversed phase; eluant: water and acetonitrile; gradient, 100:0 to 100:4). (48 mg). (iv) 3-Hydroxy-1,2-dimethyl-5-[2,2,2-trifluoro-1-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)ethyl]pyridin-4(1H)-one hydrochloride (Apo7063) was prepared from 5-(1-chloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-3-hydroxy-1,2-dimethylpyridin-4(1H)-one hydrochloride (550 mg, 1.9 mmol) and 1-methylpiperazine (3.0 mL, 27.0 mmol) was added. The reaction was stopped when analysis of the HPLC chromatogram (Method 1) of the reaction mixture complete conversion. The reaction mixture was concentrated to give a solid. To the solid was added methanol (2 mL), the mixture was vortexed and filtered.
