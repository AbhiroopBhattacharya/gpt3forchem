The residue was treated with a mixture of CHCl3 and H2O, the layers were separated and the organic phase was dried over MgSO4 and concentrated. , which was purified by chromatography on silica gel, using EtOAc\/hexane mixtures of increasing polarity as eluent, to give 0.27 g of the title compound of the example as a yellow solid (72% yield).###","completion":"72@@@","repr":"[Cl:1][C:2]1[N:3]=[CH:4][N:5]([C:14]2[CH:19]=[CH:18][C:17]([S:20]([CH3:23])(=[O:22])=[O:21])=[CH:16][CH:15]=2)[C:6]=1[C:7]1[CH:12]=[CH:11][C:10](F)=[CH:9][CH:8]=1.[NH:24]1[CH2:28][CH2:27][CH2:26][CH2:25]1>C1COCC1>[Cl:1][C:2]1[N:3]=[CH:4][N:5]([C:14]2[CH:19]=[CH:18][C:17]([S:20]([CH3:23])(=[O:22])=[O:21])=[CH:16][CH:15]=2)[C:6]=1[C:7]1[CH:12]=[CH:11][C:10]([N:24]2[CH2:28][CH2:27][CH2:26][CH2:25]2)=[CH:9][CH:8]=1"}
