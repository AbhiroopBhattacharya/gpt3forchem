# Binary checkpoints of baseline models 

## Photoswitches

- `pi_pi_star_model.joblib` GPR with Tanimoto kernel trained on _all_ data to predict the $\pi-\pi^*$ transition wavelengths using fragprints

- `n_pi_star_model.joblib` GPR with Tanimoto kernel trained on _all_ data to predict the $n-\pi^*$ transition wavelengths using fragprints

Both models have been built in the notebook `12_try_photoswitch_inverse.ipynb`.
